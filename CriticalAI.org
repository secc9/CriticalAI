  - to have a good unerstanding of what ai can do so we can uderstand what will posibly happen

  - What could be????????????????????

*** What  is AI???
*** What are some of the common issues that arise with this????
- artificial decision making?
- power to catch humans making mistakes?
- heavy lifting for humans?
- 
- neural networks


- first neural network was 1958 - Mk1 Perceptron machine
- neural networks idea has been around for a  long time
- neural networks supposedly work well on graphics processer units (GPU)
- NVIDIA is the power in this
- A feature of ai and neural networks is that no-one understands what is going on inside it even by looking inside them we don't understand them....
- We don't understand how they work and the definatly dont work in the way we do
- This is effecting peoples lives and its important to understand what it's doing and how it works
- 
  
- AI is pattern finding
  - this is based on correlation
  - as humans we have an understadning on how the world works but AI is different

- AI has to be programmed using very cheap labor
- Has a high carbon emission output to train AI
- is comen to discuss ai as abstract but in reality its a huge machine that uses up a lot of power to run
- 

** Machine Learning 
- AI is uner the umbrella of machine learning
- start of with something random and then over time it figures out what it needs to do
- Algorhtym starts with just guesses but then the algorhthm starts to calculate
- use a machine to do something over and over to finally find a best fit
-

** Neural Networks

- takes a variety of inputs to output a single thing
- started by beunbg compared to a brain but later finding out that tis isnt the case
- a number of inputs to a single output with a numner of hidden layers between
- neural networks dont need rules to figure out what it is been asked to do
- adding in hidden layer makes the output better
- [[https://ml4a.github.io/demos/f_mnist_weights/][weights and filters for numbers]]
- is a well funded area. Banks.
- This stuff isnt done for fun. The industry is operating on funding
- belief that it has real life applications
- a function is mapping one thing to another
- YOU NEED A LOT OF DATA
-

  IVE ZONED OUT NOW


- neural networks are very powerful but very fragile.
- they get it wrong
- if an image isnt in the data set then the machine doenst know what it is
- OUTER DISTRUBUTION ERRORS
- learning from flat images. doenst' have 3d models of real things
